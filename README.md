To run the program, do go run . in the Nodes folder. Open a terminal and run once for each node you wish to create.
For the first node you open, write in the same port for both the node and leader node, for subsequent nodes, give a unique port,
but declare the same leaderport.

When you have created your nodes, type /q in the terminal to queue up that node for the critical section.
A node will print a message to let you know when it enters and leaves the critical section.
